# LottoMaxCanada

My attempt to see if Canadian Lotto has any pattern that we are able to predict using deep learning techniques. Goal is to be able to use a hybrid of CNN & LSTM together to see if the prediction becomes a reality. Though the lottery is supposed to be completely random and is not a specific pattern, if we are able to bring it down to the even -10% confidence it might be close to a pattern.
